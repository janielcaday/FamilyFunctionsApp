## Description: 
This is an app that is intended for families who want to better manage tasks that need to be done around the house. Parents assign chores to their child with a due date, and the child must complete the chore before said due date showing a picture as proof. The parents then approve (granting reward points to the child) or deny the chores after viewing the photo.
